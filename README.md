# Performance Measurement of Cooperative Terahertz Multicell Networks with Imperfect Beam Alignment: A Curve-Fitting Approach
Soihem Gonmei, Joeun Kim and Taesoo Kwon

Lately, in terahertz (THz) cellular networks,
stochastic geometry framework has been employed for
deriving coverage performance. Even if the stochastic
geometry model is good for the purpose of mathematical
tractability, it suffers from being unrealistic because the
analytical model is based on many simplified assumptions i.e.,
the assumption is mainly limited to Poisson Point Process
(PPP) and simple propagation channels which are often not
applicable. And deriving analytical expression for a more
realistic scenario may be quite difficult. Hence, in this paper
we take on a simple yet more realistic model via a polynomial
function and a parameterized logistic polynomial function to
approximate the coverage in THz wireless networks with
Non-Coherent Joint Transmission (NC-JT). Our study
demonstrates that curve fitting using logistic function well
approximates the performance of THz multicell networks.
